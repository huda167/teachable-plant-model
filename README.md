# teachable-plant-model
plant classifier using teachable mechine +transorflow lit

This project uses a Teachable Machine image model to classify plant-related images.
It runs in Google Colab using TensorFlow Lite.

## Files

- model_unquant.tflite: The trained model
- labels.txt: Class labels
- test.jpg: Sample image for testing
- code.ipynb: Notebook to run prediction

## How to Use
